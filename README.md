# Project 2: Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers

## ðŸŽ¯ My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to learn Machine Learning Algorithms

## ðŸ““ Project Description 
* **Objective** - To perform EDA on data, build a Decision Tree/Random Forest model, and tune the hyperparameters.
* **Problem Statement** - Perform EDA to understand data, build a model to make accurate predictions and help company to make data driven decisions.
* **Data Source** - Provided by Great Learning as materials for the project. [Can be found in repository]

## ðŸ““Key Features Used
* Libraries used - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn
* Software used - Python programming, Google Colab

## ðŸ““ Techniques used
* **Cleaning data** from missing data, duplicated data and outliers
* **Feature Engineering** such as One-hot Encoding , Scaling
* **Data visualization** using seaborn plots
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** (Univariate and multivariate)
* **Model Building** Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers
* **Model Evaluation** using k-fold validation and a confusion matrix using f1-score, precision and recall
* **Model Tuning** via GridSearchCV

## ðŸ““ Usage Guide
**For Recruiters**
1. Open up the .ipynb or .HTML file to understand into details what was done in the project.
2. Kindly contact me if you want to know more ðŸ˜ƒ

**For Learners**
1. Download the dataset and .ipynb file.
2. Open the .ipynb file using Google Colaboratory or jupyter notebook.
3. Read through the project context, objective, data description and dictionary.
4. Try and run the code in the .ipynb notebook, cell by cell. As the codes are well-commented, try to understand what each line of code does.
5. Use my code as a reference if you're stucked (My codes are trustworthy, they have been reviewed and I obtained a full score ðŸ¥‡)
